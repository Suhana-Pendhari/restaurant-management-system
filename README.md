## 📄 Description

This Restaurant Management System is a console-based C++ application designed to streamline operations in a restaurant. The system supports two user modes: **Customer Mode** and **Owner Mode**, offering functionalities such as viewing the menu, placing orders, managing staff, tracking sales, and monitoring inventory.

The project utilizes core C++ concepts including **Object-Oriented Programming**, **File Handling**, **Exception Handling**, and the **Standard Template Library (STL)**. All restaurant data (menu, employees, orders, etc.) is stored in text files to simulate real-world persistence.
